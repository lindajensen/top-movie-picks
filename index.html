                    <p>"Boondock Saints" is a vigilante action thriller that follows to Irish Brothers who's trying to take down Boston's criminals. The film is a character driven ride filled with witty dialogue and satire. It has some truly thought-provoking moments, but is also home to one of the best F-bombs in movie history. For me, everything about this film is a cinematic party!</p>

                <p>"Arrival" is a one of the greatest sci-fi films of all time. The entire film is centered around the perception of time. It has an incredible story, characters, and an equally remarkable soundtrack. The film is beautiful and complex and even if you're not a sci-fi fan this is not a film you want to miss.</p>
